    <p>The project <span>"The Unexpected"</span> was inspired the concept of finding the beauty in the unexpected. Often times, things in life do not
        turn out the way we want. However, it does not mean one should completely lose hope. The particles in the sketch are meant to represent
        hopes, and dreams. At first, the particles are itty bitty when it is first birthed. However, once one clicks the mouse as an interaction, the 
        particles change colors and move at a faster rate. But, the particles change paths after it touches the boundary to show how things will come
        back different from what one expected. Afterwards, one can click on key "A" for the particle's to increase in size and have 
        this echoey affect to show how one's dreams and hopes can blossom. However, when the key "B" is pressed, the particles disappear to represent
        one fully giving up on what they want. The main message for this sketch is to represent a more hopeful way of thinking.
